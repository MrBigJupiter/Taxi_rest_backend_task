Columns inside the database:
- id (unique id for the vehicle)(primary_key)
- fuel_type (fuel or hybrid)
- distance (how much a car can go in one sitting)
- seats (number of seats available for passangers: INT)
- license_plate_number(str)
- car_brand (eg: Mercedes, Audi, Toyota)
- driver_name (str) 
- on_route()bool
- available_from(datetime)



Logic behind:

Input parameters are:
    1. Number of passangers
    2. Distance to be driven 

Conditions:
    1. Every vehicle is fully tanked immidiately after every trip
    2. If a trip is <50km then every kilometer takes 2minutes
    3. If a trip is > 50km then every kilometer takes 1minutes
    Hybrid car conditions:
        4. For hybrid cars inside city (under 50km) radius their distance is shortened 1km after every 2km traveled

Profit calculating:
    Profit:
        1. Every km is 2EUR and every half hour started is also 2EUR (even if by one minutes)
    Costs
        2.Every km traveled is 2EUR in cost and only 1EUR for Electric (Hybrid) 

Output:
    List all combinations of available vehicles and their assumed profit
